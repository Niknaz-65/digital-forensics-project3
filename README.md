## 🧩 Overview
This **PowerPoint presentation** explores a simulated **forensic analysis of a system intrusion**, focusing on identifying key evidence through log analysis, startup folder inspection, and data exfiltration detection.  
It builds on previous projects by applying real-world digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) techniques to reconstruct an intrusion timeline and recommend remediation actions.

## 🧠 Tools & Techniques
- 🔍 IIS Web Server Log Analysis  
- 🧩 Autoruns & Startup Folder Inspection  
- 🗓️ Scheduled Task Review  
- 💻 Evidence of Data Exfiltration  
- 🧮 Digital Artifact Correlation & Timeline Building  

---

## ⚙️ Key Objectives
1. Examine system and IIS logs to identify malicious activity.  
2. Analyze autorun and startup entries to detect persistence.  
3. Uncover indicators of compromise (IOCs) and exfiltration evidence.  
4. Recommend next steps for remediation and prevention.
